# Adafruit Uncanny Eye on ESP32 NTSC Composite Video

## The idea:

A = __rossumer__'s
[ESP_8_BIT project](https://github.com/rossumur/esp_8_bit) project's
color composite video code, extracted at
[my fork](https://github.com/Roger-random/esp_8_bit.git).

B = __Adafruit__'s
[Uncanny Eyes](https://github.com/adafruit/uncanny_eyes) project.

A + B = Uncanny Eye on a NTSC TV via composite video, running on an ESP32

## The execution:

Just getting started!
